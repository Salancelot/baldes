      BALDES (pronounced /'baw-d…®s/) is a C++ implementation of a Bucket Graph-based labeling algorithm designed to solve the Resource-Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RSCPP), commonly used as a subproblem in state-of-the-art Branch-Cut-and-Price algorithms for various Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs).

The algorithm is based on the approach presented in the paper:  
**A Bucket Graph Based Labeling Algorithm for Vehicle Routing** by Sadykov et al.

## üìù Overview

The Bucket Graph-based labeling algorithm organizes labels into **buckets** based on vertex and resource consumption intervals. This structure reduces the number of dominance checks, making the algorithm highly efficient, particularly in large VRP instances with extensive resource constraints.

### üöÄ Key Features

- **Bucket Graph Organization:** Grouping labels by vertex and resource consumption to minimize dominance checks, using n-dimensional Splay Trees to keep the most acessed buckets easier to reach.
- **Parallel Bi-Directional Labeling:** Supports forward and backward search strategies.
- **Dominance Rules:** Efficient dominance checks using resource-based comparisons and integration of additional criteria from Limited-Memory Subset Row Cuts (SRCs) for enhanced speed.
- **Multi-phase solving:** Out-of-the-box multi-phase solving that begins with heuristics and dynamically guides the algorithm towards an exact solution.
- **Good initial solutions** Utilizes the state-of-the-art HGS-VRPTW algorithm to generate high-quality initial bounds and routes, an extension of the HGS-CVRP method employed by the ORTEC team to win the VRPTW track at the DIMACS Implementation Challenge. We also enchanced the HGS-VRPTW with the concepts proposed in [MDM-HGS-CVRP](https://github.com/marcelorhmaia/MDM-HGS-CVRP/).
- **Improvement Heuristics:** Optional fast improvement heuristics are applied at the end of each labeling phase to enhance label quality.

**Resource Disposability Definition**

To control how each resource is treated (whether disposable, non-disposable, or binary), it is necessary to define a vector using the `#define RESOURCES_DISPOSABLE` directive. Each position in this vector corresponds to a specific resource and should be assigned a value of `0`, `1`, or `2` to indicate the disposability type:

- **0**: Disposable resource ‚Äì the resource can be consumed or reset during the routing process.
- **1**: Non-disposable resource ‚Äì the resource is conserved and cannot be disposed of.
- **2**: Binary resource ‚Äì the resource toggles between two states (e.g., `0` for off and `1` for on).

```cpp
#define RESOURCES_DISPOSABLE {0, 1, 2, 1}
```

> **Note 1**: Including depot and depot copy (end node).
 
> **Note 2**: Both `SRC` and `SRC3` cannot be enabled simultaneously. Ensure only one is selected.

> **Note 3**: Only one stabilization can be selected.

**TUI**

If you prefer, you can run the configurer tool, which provides a TUI for configuring BALDES.

```sh
./configurer.sh
```

## üìÇ Input File Format

The input file should specify the number of jobs, time horizon, vehicle capacities, and other VRP constraints.  
See examples in the `examples/` directory.

### üöÄ Running the Example Algorithm

To run Solomon instances in the `example` folder:

```bash
./vrptw C203.txt
```

### üêç Python Wrapper

We also provide a Python wrapper, which can be used to instantiate the bucket graph labeling:

```python
import random

# Now you can import the BALDES module
import baldes

# Define jobs
jobs = [baldes.VRPJob() for _ in range(102)]
num_intervals = 1

# Set random bounds for each job
id = 0
for job in jobs:
    job.lb = [random.randint(0, 9000) for _ in range(num_intervals)]  # Set random lower bounds
    job.ub = [random.randint(lb + 1, 10000) for lb in job.lb]  # Set random upper bounds greater than lb
    job.duration = random.randint(1, 100)  # Set random duration
    job.cost = random.randint(1, 100)  # Set random cost
    job.start_time = random.randint(0, 10000)  # Set random start time
    job.end_time = random.randint(job.start_time, 10000)  # Set random end time greater than start time
    job.demand = random.randint(1, 100)  # Set random demand
    job.consumption = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(num_intervals)]  # Set random consumption
    job.set_location(random.randint(0, 100), random.randint(0, 100))  # Set random location
    job.id = id
    id += 1

# Create fake distance matrix with size equal to the number of jobs
distances = [[random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(len(jobs))] for _ in range(len(jobs))]

# Initialize BucketGraph using these jobs
bg = baldes.BucketGraph(jobs, 12000, 1)

# Create random duals with size equal to the number of jobs
duals = [random.random() for _ in range(len(jobs))]

# Set the distance matrix, adjacency list, and duals
bg.set_distance_matrix(distances)
bg.set_adjacency_list()
bg.set_duals(duals)
bg.setup()

# Call the solve method
labels = bg.solve()
```
