**BALDES**: A Bucket Graph Labeling Algorithm for Vehicle Routing

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Bucket Graph-based labeling algorithm designed to solve the Resource-Constrained Shortest Path Problem (RSCPP), commonly used as a subproblem in state-of-the-art Branch-Cut-and-Price algorithms for various Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs).

The algorithm is based on the approach presented in the paper:  
**A Bucket Graph Based Labeling Algorithm for Vehicle Routing** by Sadykov et al.

## üìù Overview

The Bucket Graph-based labeling algorithm organizes labels into **buckets** based on both vertex and resource consumption intervals. This structure reduces the number of dominance checks, making the algorithm highly efficient, particularly in large VRP instances with extensive resource constraints.

### üöÄ Key Features

- **Bucket Graph Organization:** Grouping labels by vertex and resource consumption to minimize dominance checks.
- **Parallel Bi-Directional Labeling:** Supports both forward and backward search strategies.
- **Dominance Rules:** Efficient dominance checks using resource-based comparisons and integration of additional criteria from Limited-Memory Subset Row Cuts (SRCs).
- **Improvement Heuristics:** Optional fast improvement heuristics applied at the end of each labeling phase to enhance label quality.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

Some features are experimental and subject to ongoing improvements:

- **[experimental]** Limited-Memory Subset Row Cuts
- **[experimental]** Knapsack Completion Bounds for Capacity Constraints
- **[experimental]** Bucket Arc Elimination

This structure helps to better differentiate between the boolean options and other numerical parameters or settings in the configuration.

> **Note 1**: Including depot and depot copy (end node).
 
> **Note 2**: Both `SRC` and `SRC3` cannot be enabled simultaneously. Ensure only one is selected.

> **Note 3**: Only one stabilization can be selected.

### üìÇ Input File Format

The input file should specify the number of jobs, time horizon, vehicle capacities, and other VRP constraints.  
See examples in the `examples/` directory.

### üöÄ Running the Example Algorithm

To run Solomon instances in the `example` folder:

```bash
./vrptw C203.txt
```

### üêç Python Wrapper

We also provide a Python wrapper, which can be used to instantiate the bucket graph labeling:

```python
import random

# Import the BALDES library
import bucket_graph

# Define jobs
jobs = [bucket_graph.VRPJob() for _ in range(102)]
num_resources = 1
# Set random bounds for each job
id = 0
for job in jobs:
    job.lb = [random.randint(0, 9000) for _ in range(num_resources)]  # Set random lower bounds
    job.ub = [random.randint(lb + 1, 10000) for lb in job.lb]  # Set random upper bounds greater than lb
    job.duration = random.randint(1, 100)  # Set random duration
    job.cost = random.randint(1, 100)  # Set random cost
    job.start_time = random.randint(0, 10000)  # Set random start time
    job.end_time = random.randint(job.start_time, 10000)  # Set random end time greater than start time
    job.demand = random.randint(1, 100)  # Set random demand
    job.consumption = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(num_resources)]  # Set random consumption
    job.set_location(random.randint(0, 100), random.randint(0, 100))  # Set random location
    job.id = id
    id += 1

# Create fake distance matrix with size equal to the number of jobs
distances = [[random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(len(jobs))] for _ in range(len(jobs))]

# Initialize BucketGraph using these jobs
bg = bucket_graph.BucketGraph(jobs, 10000, 10)

# Create random duals with size equal to the number of jobs
duals = [random.random() for _ in range(len(jobs))]

print("Duals before setting them in the BucketGraph:")
print(duals)

bg.set_distance_matrix(distances)
bg.set_adjacency_list()
bg.set_duals(duals)
bg.setup()
```
